conventions:
  file_naming:
    - Use snake_case for Python files
    - Use kebab-case for TypeScript/React components
    - Use PascalCase for React component filenames
    - Test files end with .test.ts or .test.py
    - Group by feature, not by file type
    - Shared code goes in `packages/`
    - Keep nesting under 4 levels deep
    - Co-locate tests with source files
